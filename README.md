# Get_next_line
Welcome to get_next_line!

## Summary
In the get_next_line project at 42, we are tasked with writing a C function called get_next_line that can read and return the next available line from a file or standard input each time the function is called. Although seemingly simple, this project is crucial for understanding advanced input/output (I/O) concepts in C, such as handling file descriptors, dynamic memory management, and efficient reading of data line by line. get_next_line is valuable not only for its practical application but also because it lays the groundwork for understanding more advanced concepts in C programming.
